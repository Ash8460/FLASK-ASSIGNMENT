        "01. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "A RESTful API, or REST API, is a way for computer systems to exchange information over the internet. It's based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, which uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Essentially, it provides a set of rules for how clients and servers should communicate when accessing and manipulating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "02. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "An API specification is a formal document that outlines how an API should function and interact with other systems. It acts as a blueprint, defining the structure, data formats, and behavior of the API. This allows developers to understand how to use the API without needing to see the underlying code or implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "03. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight micro web framework in Python, well-suited for building RESTful APIs due to its flexibility and simplicity. Its popularity stems from being easy to learn, maintain, and extend. Flask is often preferred for API development because it provides a streamlined approach to building web applications and APIs without unnecessary overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "04. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "routes in Flask are the glue that connects specific URL paths to their corresponding view functions. They provide a straightforward way to define the behavior of a web application, making it easier for developers to build and maintain their projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "05. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "Here's how to create a basic Flask application:\n",
        "1. Installation Install Flask using pip.\n",
        "Code\n",
        "\n",
        "     pip install Flask\n",
        "2. Project Structure\n",
        "Create a folder for your project.\n",
        "Inside the folder, create a Python file (e.g., app.py).\n",
        "3. Basic App Code\n",
        "In app.py, add the following code:\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "     from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "     app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "     @app.route('/')\n",
        "     def hello_world():\n",
        "         return 'Hello, World!'\n",
        "\n",
        "     if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "         app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "from flask import Flask: Imports the Flask class.\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__): Creates a Flask application instance.\n",
        "@app.route('/'): Decorator that defines the URL route.\n",
        "def hello_world(): Function that returns the response.\n",
        "app.run(debug=True): Runs the development server.\n",
        "4. Running the App Open a terminal or command prompt, Navigate to your project directory, and Run the command.\n",
        "\n",
        "06. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "In RESTful APIs, the primary HTTP methods used for interacting with resources are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Other methods exist, but these are the most frequently employed.\n",
        "\n",
        "07. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "The @app.route() decorator in Flask serves as a crucial mechanism for mapping specific URLs to Python functions. It essentially establishes the routes of your web application, determining which function should be executed when a user requests a particular URL.\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its purpose:\n",
        "**URL Mapping:**\n",
        "The decorator associates a given URL pattern with a designated function. For example, @app.route('/home') would link the /home URL to the function immediately following the decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Request Handling:**\n",
        "When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask consults its internal route map. If a match is found, the corresponding function is invoked to handle the request and generate the appropriate response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplification:**\n",
        "The decorator simplifies the process of defining routes. Without it, you would need to manually register each function with a URL, making the code more verbose and less readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flexibility:**\n",
        "The @app.route() decorator supports dynamic URL segments, allowing you to capture parts of the URL as arguments for your function. This is useful for creating flexible and reusable routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decorator Functionality:**\n",
        "In Python, decorators are a design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. The @app.route decorator is a specific example of this, where it extends the behavior of the function it decorates by associating it with a route.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "08. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "The main difference between GET and POST HTTP methods lies in how they transmit data and their side effects. GET retrieves data from a server, with parameters appended to the URL, and is generally idempotent (safe to repeat). POST, on the other hand, sends data to the server, often to create or update resources, and is not inherently idempotent.\n",
        "\n",
        "09. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "Error handling for REST\n",
        "\n",
        "Use HTTP status codes properly: REST APIs rely heavily on standard HTTP status codes to communicate the nature of an error. ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide enough detail in error messages: REST is stateless in nature. ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Use a standardized error response format: Maintain a consistent standard for error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "To create a database we need to import SQLAlchemy in app.py, set up SQLite configuration, and create a database instance as shown below. We set up Flask, connect it to a SQLite database (site. db), and use db. create_all() to create the database when the app runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that makes using SQLAlchemy with Flask easier, providing you tools and methods to interact with your database in your Flask applications through SQLAlchemy. In this tutorial, you'll build a small student management system that demonstrates how to use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "Flask blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into reusable and most importantly maintainable units. With blueprints, you can break your application into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to maintain and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "**ANS.**\n",
        "The Flask request object is a crucial component for handling incoming HTTP requests in a Flask web application. It provides access to all the data sent by the client, such as form data, URL parameters, headers, and the request method.\n",

        "Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization, especially when dealing with third-party applications.\n",
        "API Keys:\n",
